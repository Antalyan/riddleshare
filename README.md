**Project description**

Our web application enables users to share their own riddles with each other and solve them through the portal. **Feel free to try it out and add your riddles or try to solve the existing ones, it is completely free!**

Only registered users can create or solve a riddle. A riddle is either text or picture-based. Multiple riddles can be combined into a series, which can be set to be solved either in parallel or in linear order.

Riddles can be set as public and shared using a link, or shared only with selected users. 

If a riddle is too difficult, a user may ask for a hint. After solving all the questions, a surprise prepared by the riddle author is unlocked.

Users can manage the riddles they created and view the answers of other users to them. They can also see the history of all the riddles they tried to solve.
